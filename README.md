Code for _The stability of convection in the North Atlantic subpolar gyre in a conceptual model_ 

Notebooks starting with _fig__ were used to generate the figures in the article; the notebook table-R generates the data for the table summarizing the state ratio R for different noise values. _fig-checkstates_ is more of a sanity check than a fully developed notebook, and the figures are not included in the manuscript.

AuxiliaryFunctions/* contains the model and additional functions used for plotting.
Data/* contains the data that was generated for an initial version of the heatmap; Data_21Sv is the data that was used
Figures/* contains the figure files.
